# isomorphic-javascript-nashorn-example

Example of isomorphic rendering of reactJS components using Nashorn.

## Nashorn

Nashorn is Javaâ€™s embedded JavaScript engine that comes part of Java 8.  Nashorn will compile JavaScript to Java bytecode providing interoperability between Java and JavaScript code.  

This repo demonstrates running server-side render of a react component using Java.  It uses maven and spring-boot to compile and launch an embedded web server (but, in general, these are not required for doing server-side rendering of reactJS components using Nashorn)

## Installation instructions

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
```

To run:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then go to: http://localhost:8080/
