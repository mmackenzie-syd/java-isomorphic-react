# isomorphic-javascript-nashorn-example

Comparison of isomorphic rendering of reactJS using Nashorn and GraalVM.

This code was taken from Kumar Chandrakant's https://www.baeldung.com/react-nashorn-isomorphic-app and Yogen Rai's setup for Spring Boot with JSP https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-2-with-jsp-view

The GraalVM was added as an import.

## Nashorn

Nashorn is Javaâ€™s embedded JavaScript engine that comes part of Java 8.  Nashorn will compile JavaScript to Java bytecode providing interoperability between Java and JavaScript code.  

This repo demonstrates running server-side render of a react component using Java.  It uses maven and spring-boot to compile and launch an embedded web server (but, in general, these are not required for doing server-side rendering of reactJS components using Nashorn)

## Installation instructions

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
